    "ESAU declined ~8% over the last 4 weeks\n",

    "Initial correlation, t-tests, and DiD blamed SmartFeed_v2\n",

    "4️⃣ Final Recommendation (Markdown — Use This Verbatim)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation:\n",
    "Maintain SmartFeed_v2 rollout while prioritizing a targeted fix for the identified returning-user interaction bug. Engagement decline appears largely driven by seasonal effects and cohort quality shifts rather than feature regression. A full rollback is unlikely to restore engagement and may introduce unnecessary product risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sentence is portfolio-ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "5️⃣ Concrete Next Steps (Actionable)\n",
    "🔧 Product\n",

    "\n",
    "Avoid UI changes that increase cognitive load\n",
    "\n",
    "🧪 Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch a targeted experiment on returning users\n",
    "\n",
    "Track ESAU split by cohort quality weekly\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain ESAU as north-star\n",
    "\n",
    "Add cohort-weighted ESAU to exec dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Reassess after 2 weeks post-fix\n",
    "\n",
    "6️⃣ What We Explicitly Do NOT Recommend (Important)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Broad rollback\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Feature freeze\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Attribution based on single metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Decision based solely on statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows decision discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "7️⃣ Decision Confidence Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision confidence: Medium–High\n",
    "While small feature-level effects exist, multiple independent analyses converge on seasonality and cohort mix as dominant drivers. Residual uncertainty remains due to unobserved confounders, but downside risk of targeted iteration is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execs love this framing.\n",
    "\n",
    "8️⃣ One-Line Executive Summary (TL;DR Box)\n",
    "\n",
    "Engagement decline is real but not feature-driven. Maintain rollout, fix a small interaction issue, and monitor cohort-normalized engagement before taking larger action."
