    <h2>The Decision Leadership Needed</h2>
    <p>The product is a B2C, feed-based application where user engagement directly impacts retention and long-term revenue. Engagement is closely monitored by leadership and often used as an early warning signal for product regressions.</p>
    <p>Shortly after the gradual rollout of a new feed experience, leadership observed a sustained decline in engagement. The timing raised immediate concern that the feature had negatively impacted user behavior. The decision at stake was whether to rollback the feature, pause further rollout, or continue with targeted iteration.</p>

  <h2>The Data Behind the Decision</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    To determine whether the feed update caused the drop,

  <h2>The Standard Analysis (What Most Teams Would Do)</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    The initial evidence appeared to point clearly toward a rollback.

    Following the conventional analytics playbook, the analysis began with

      <p>The flaw was not in the math, but in the assumptions.</p>
      <p>Feature exposure was <strong>endogenous</strong>. Higher-engagement users were more likely to be exposed, and cohort composition shifted materially during the post period. At the same time, the post-launch window included seasonality and natural engagement decay.</p>

  <h2>Agentic Investigation: Structuring the Root Cause Analysis</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    Before applying deeper causal methods,
    the challenge was not computation,
    but deciding <em>what to test</em> and <em>in what order</em>
    under time pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    To avoid anchoring on the most visible explanation (the feature),
    I designed an <strong>agentic investigation framework</strong>
    that systematically evaluated competing hypotheses
    behind the engagement decline.
  </p>

  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <h4>Hypothesis generation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Feature regression from the new feed</li>
        <li>Seasonality and calendar effects</li>
        <li>User quality and acquisition mix shift</li>
        <li>Instrumentation or logging issues</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Prevents premature fixation on a single narrative.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Agent-driven test planning</h4>
      <p>
        The agent ranked hypotheses by plausibility,
        expected impact, and cost of validation,
        then selected appropriate analytical tests.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cohort stability checks</li>
        <li>Pre/post balance diagnostics</li>
        <li>Segment-level trend analysis</li>
        <li>Causal estimation where warranted</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Evidence synthesis</h4>
      <p>
        Results from each test were summarized
        and evaluated jointly rather than in isolation.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Avoids overreacting to statistically significant
        but economically misleading signals.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="findings">
    <strong>Why this mattered</strong>
    <p>
      The agentic layer ensured the analysis remained
      hypothesis-driven rather than metric-driven,
      narrowing the root cause before applying
      Difference-in-Differences and matching.

  </div>

<section id="approach">
  <h2>My Approach: Estimating the Counterfactual</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    The critical question was not whether engagement changed,
    but what would have happened <em>without</em> the feed update.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because exposure to the feature was non-random,
    the counterfactual could not be observed directly.
    The analysis therefore focused on constructing a defensible
    approximation using only pre-rollout information.
  </p>

  <div class="cards">
    <div class="card">
      <h4>Freeze pre-treatment behavior</h4>
      <p>
        User features were engineered exclusively from behavior observed
        before the rollout.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Prevents post-treatment leakage.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Model exposure propensity</h4>
      <p>
        A propensity model estimated each user’s likelihood of receiving
        the new feed based on baseline engagement and lifecycle stage.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Makes selection bias explicit.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h4>Match comparable users</h4>

        Treated users were matched to control users
        with similar propensity scores.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Approximates a randomized experiment.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Engagement outcomes were then compared over the full post period,
    avoiding unstable daily ratios that exaggerate noise.

  <p class="lead">
    Matching is only valid if treated and control users overlap.

    <strong>What this enabled</strong>
    <p>
      By comparing users who looked similar before exposure,
